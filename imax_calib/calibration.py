    Use this function to access all calibrators (binning).
    Inputs are the raw network logits and one-hot labels.
    The kwargs can be used to send other arguments which some calibrators might need.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cfg: dict
        config dictionary containing all information.
    logits: numpy ndarray
        raw network logits
    logodds: numpy ndarray
        raw network logodds. use utils.quick_logits_to_logodds(logits) to get them

        one-hot target labels
